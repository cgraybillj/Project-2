This is my second project using html and css. My code creates an search engine for Giphy API using Jquery .ajax() method. Improvement:

With future knowledge of Javascript or Jquery it maybe be a good idea to revise it and create a more dynamic version.
Need to also add a way to store the values users input.
Need to fix the contact page and about page. Its kind of lame.
